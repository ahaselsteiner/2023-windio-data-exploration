# Exploration of two WindIO datasets
This repo contains a Matlab script for exploration of two WindIO datasets:
 * the first dataset containts acceleration data from the Krogmann wind turbine in Bremerhaven.
 * the second dataset contains acceleration data from a Senvion wind turbine in Bremen.

Run the file analyze_msb_and_lidar.m

The datasets are not public such that you need to contact Andreas (a.haselsteiner@uni-bremen.de) to ask for the datasets to successfully run this script.

Please note that is a data analysis script and not a polished software.
